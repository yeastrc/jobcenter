
This directory contains sample files that can be copied to the "config" directory
for overriding the configuration in the jar file for this module.

The file "blast_module_config.properties" MUST be copied to the config directory
and configured.

It is recommended to copy the file "jobcenter_module_config_per_client.properties"
so that the values are visible in the config rather than using the defaults in the
jar file
